Starting Monday to prepare for bed. Get everything in place and check with your tech. When people enter, greet them and let them know how comfortable they'll be. Ice Break: "The facilitator is responsible for leading the design sprint method and keeping the team on track. They ensure that the team stays focused and follows the sprint schedule, and help to facilitate discussions and decision-making. The designer is responsible for creating visual prototypes of the solution being tested in the sprint. They may work with a variety of design tools, such as sketching, wireframing, or prototyping software. The researcher is responsible for conducting customer research and gathering insights to inform the solution being developed in the sprint. This may involve conducting user interviews, usability tests, or other forms of research to understand the needs and behaviors of the target audience. The prototyping expert is responsible for creating functional prototypes of the solution being tested in the sprint. They may work with a variety of prototyping tools and techniques, such as coding, 3D printing, or physical modeling. The subject matter expert is a domain specialist who brings in-depth knowledge and expertise to the design sprint. They may be a specialist in a particular industry, technology, or method, and can provide valuable insights and guidance to the team. Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have a vested interest in the outcome of the design sprint. They may be senior leaders, customers, or other key stakeholders within the organization. Stakeholders may participate in the sprint by providing input and feedback, or by helping to define the problem being addressed."
