### What is an MVP?

An MVP is not a minimal viable product but rather a product with just enough features to test a concept's viability and receive customer feedback.

MVPs are often created with the rapid prototyping approach, which utilizes low-fidelity mockups that are quicker and easier to make than a high-fidelity prototype. They are usually designed with paper click-throughs that allow faster iteration cycles and easier changes than high-fidelity prototypes.

![user interface](/blog/minimum-viable-product-mvp-development-step-by-step-guide/mvp05.png)

An MVP is a product or service with the minimum features necessary to solve a specific problem or meet a particular need. It is designed to test the viability of an idea and gather feedback from potential customers as quickly and cheaply as possible.

You will need to build an MVP not to create a fully-featured product but to determine if the concept is worth pursuing and gather valuable insights from customers.

MVPs can be physical products, websites, landing pages, or paper prototypes. The key is that they are the least expensive and quickest way to start testing an idea. An MVP might not have all of the bells and whistles of a finished product, but it helps the company test the concept's viability and get feedback from potential customers as quickly and cheaply as possible.

An MVP does not have to be a physical product; it can also be a piece of content like a blog post or email campaign. The key is to start experimenting with your idea as quickly as possible to see if it generates interest.

Over time, you can improve and refine your MVP to create a polished and profitable product.
